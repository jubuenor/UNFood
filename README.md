# UNFood
Platform aimed at streamlining the interaction between consumers and growers, particularly within university campuses. Our focus is on reducing the time spent in queues ('chazas') by enabling customers to pre-order products from these vendors. By facilitating advance orders, we optimize the preparation space for vendors and alleviate congestion during peak hours. Our application provides an intuitive interface for users to browse products, place orders remotely, and track their status until ready for pickup. Join us in revolutionizing the university shopping experience with seamless technology integration.
